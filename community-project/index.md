# Clubs Community Project

## Overview

*Facilitator Note: Clubs philosophy, community project is a way to motivate student learning.*

Over the course of the year, your club will complete a community project. AS a team, your entire club will plan and execute a project that impacts your community using computer science.

------

There are two types of projects which your club may choose from:

##CREATE:

Build a tool or product that addresses an issue in your community.

**Examples:**

* A website that XXXXXXXX.
* A game that XXXXXXX.
* A mobile app that XXXXXXX.

## INSPIRE:

Teach your community how to use computer science to create their own tools or products to help themselves.

**Examples:**

* Host a hackathon.
* Organize and lead a programming workshop.
* Create a programming video tutorial and put it on YouTube.

------

Together, your club will complete *either* a Create project or an Inspire project.
